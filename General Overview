Hai~ ✿♬ﾟ+.(｡◡‿◡)♪.+ﾟ♬✿。 I'm Kirby2004ppg (Kirbs) and I'm trying to make a bot for discord out of C# programming! Introducing B()T!

I'm not an expert at programming; you probably shouldn't ask me for help...

But I'm currently working on making B()T more user friendly and have more functions!

I've compiled a list of commands and I will be updating it frequently! (So as this document.)

Oh, btw...
Please help me with learning C# and give me suggestions as to what to add! Help is welcomed and NEEDED!!!!!

Currently, I'm wondering about commands such as: (in no particular order)

  - A command for restarting the bot
  - How to let users search for a video on youtube and be able to post the title of the video and a thumbnail in the future
  - A kick/ban command
  - How to join a bot to another server (Me: @△@??)
  - Sending notes command (all users) and being able to read them, or block users
  - A simple game? I'm not really sure about this, help me think of one!
  - A calculator (I have only crudely made one on Python lel)
  - Be able to create a greeting with certain conditions such as when a new user enters the room
  - Have a gambling system and an ORIGINAL currency with a system (such as commands like being able to give, take (for admins), and most
  importantly, be able to give owner infinite amount of money) -- Should I and how do I input a negative amount of money?
  - Each user has a status card
  - How do I get like a database/log of the users and their stats or stuff? Lol
  - Some kind of battle system idk
  - Typing contest?
  - I'm running out of ideas... oh!
  - Let the bot have some commands which will instead go into the user's PMs

I'm sure I've pretty much fried my brain now, so please help me! (^~^)9

I'm creating this bot basically as a hobby, so I don't request for funding or of any sort. ╮ (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) ╭

Halp me ;-; -Kirbs
