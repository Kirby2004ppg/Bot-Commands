Currently, I have 2 commands. I tried adding a "help" command, but it gave me an error, saying that Log did not work.
A bit of my code: 

            RegisterNekoCommand();
            RegisterPurgeCommand();
            // I tried adding RegisterHelpCommand(); here, scroll down vv

            discord.ExecuteAndWait(async () =>
            {
                await discord.Connect("MzA0NDA5ODQ4Mjg2Njc0OTY0.C9m1Gg.eIzQI--GV9e5jgUwaHjLskalVGc", TokenType.Bot);
            });
        }

            private void RegisterNekoCommand()
            {
                commands.CreateCommand("neko")
                    .Do(async (e) =>
                {
                    int randomneko = rand.Next(nekos.Length);
                    string nekotopost = nekos[randomneko];
                    await e.Channel.SendFile(nekotopost);
                });
            }

            private void RegisterPurgeCommand()
            {
                commands.CreateCommand("purge")
                    .Do(async (e) =>
                    {
                        Message[] messagesToDelete;
                        messagesToDelete = await e.Channel.DownloadMessages(100);

                        await e.Channel.DeleteMessages(messagesToDelete);
                });
            }
            
            //tried adding 
            'private void RegisterHelpCommand()
            {
               commands.CreateCommand("help"
                    .Do(async () =>
                    {
                        await e.Channel.SendMessage("Check out my blah blah blah");
                    }
                    
            private void Log(object sender, LogMessageEventArgs e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e.Message); 
            }
        }

      
    }
    
    I tried to run this code, but VisualStudio says that Log on line 48 was now "invalid" and it could not run. I'm not quite sure how to 
    write this correctly or where to put it. 
    
    Issue #2!
    Sometimes I run the bot with a random image generator from my gallergy of images, and I can't type out the command more 
    than once or twice before it has what it seems to be a cool down period. Just wondering.
